# Problem 2

## Import and tidy up the dataset

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

This dataset has 52179 rows and 12 columns. The columns(variables) are
uid, reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age,
victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition and each row is a
homicide incident.

``` r
homicide_data=
  homicide_data %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)
    ) %>%
    filter(city_state != "Dallas, Tx", city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", city_state != "Kansas City, MO", city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>% 
  drop_na(victim_age)
```

Created a new variable `city_state` by concatenating city and state,
seperateing with ‘,’. \`\`\`
